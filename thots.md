There is this conflic between what we are trying to do and what beckn is trying to be

We have this hirearchy of providers and then this integrated currency regulated by the registry or mulearn itself

While the underlying beckn protocol just is an intent matching protocol , basically what we are trying to do is

client <-> Gateway + Primary Provider / Registry / Overload Big Boi <-> secondary providers

This makes it so that our core mulearn network is now having more stateful shit that it needs to handle than just simply what services or api end points there are and who provides them . I feel like We need to be mindful of this before we just keep building on top of it and lose our way , take a moment and think about is that what we want
(but hey i got a fk ton of freetime with me , so ... we can try doing it the dumb way first too ig)
